# This subset seed was described in:
# "YASS: enhancing the sensitivity of DNA similarity search"
# by L No√© & G Kucherov, NAR 2005 33:W540-W543.
# According to them, it provides a good compromise in detecting
# similarities for both coding and non-coding DNA.

# In positions with "AG CT", A and G are treated as equivalent, and C
# and T are treated as equivalent (i.e. transitions are tolerated).
# In positions with "ACGT", all four bases are treated as equivalent
# (i.e. mismatches are tolerated).  In positions with "A C G T", only
# exact matches are allowed.  Letters that don't appear (e.g. N) are
# not allowed to match.

# (The final three positions of the YASS seed are commented out here,
# because they are the same as the first three positions, and LAST
# cyclically repeats the seed anyway.)
